# Realtime Optical Character Recognition with Deep Learning  [![Build Status](https://ci.tensorflow.org/buildStatus/icon?job=tensorflow-master-cpu)](https://github.com/michaelzhiluo/OCR-Deep-Learning)
OCR-Deep-Learning uses a webcam projected on a computer screen to identify the digits 0-9. This project uses both MNIST database and my own dataset of computer-digits to train a three-layer Convolutional Neural Network.

The recognition rate for computer digits is around 99.84%.
